# Churn-Exploratory-File
This dataset diplays the amount of people that have churned from a telecommunication company. The main question is why are customers churning and what can be done to retain customers. In this project, I used excel to clean the data first, then I explored the data using SQL in mySQL workbench. I expressed  my findings in percents to have an easier way to keep track and compare which users had the highest churn rate. I then took my findings to excel and used pivot tables and charts to visualize my discovery.

My Discoveries:
* Almost 75% of the churned customers do not identify as Senior Citizens 
* 57% of the churned customers paid via electronic checks and also had the highest average monthly charges.
* Fiber Optics customers had the highest churn rate and their monthly average charge was 1.7x more than the charges of DSL users and 4.4x more than customers with no internet service at all.
* Customers who opted in for phone service made up 91% of the churned cutomers.

My Recommendations:
* Senior citizens most likely have personalized offers that's why they have a  higher retain rate, so I suggest having personalized offers for the other age groups 
* There's most likely a fee for people who pay with electronic checks, I propose eliminating this fee
* Improved quality for services offered by Fiber Optics
* Having special offers/discount for customers with multiple services since they are the ones spending the most money

What I learned:
* I improved my SQL skills by writing intermidiate queries (subqueries)
* Learned how to create visualizitions with pivot tables and charts
* Practiced clear documentation of my insights
* Put critical thinking skills to the test
