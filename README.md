# Churn-Exploratory-File
In this project, I practice my SQL queries, by exploring a dataset posting Customers who have churned from a Service Provider based on different attributes.
I  first cleaned the data in excel. The data was pretty clean so I just changed on of the columns where the output were ones and zeros, I changed this so that it would be easier to understand the values.
I explored the data with sql. I checked the amount of people who churned and what services they used. This help me come to a conclusion that certain services had more customers who churned. Meaning these services were either not meeting customer satsifaction or the price was too expensive for customers.
I was able to determine that price was a factor by checking the average price per service. Some services with more churned customers had higher average monthly charges.
