# Churn-Exploratory-File

**Overview:**
This project analyzes customer churn for a telecommunications company. The goal is to identify key drivers of churn and recommend strategies for retentions.

**Tools Used:**
- **Excel:** Data cleaning, pivot tables, and visualization
- **MySQL Workbench:** Data exploration and querying
- **Tableau:** Interactive Dashboards for presenting insights

**Key Findings:**
* Nearly 75% of the churned customers do not identify as Senior Citizens, suggesting younger groups are at higher a risk of churning.
* 57% of the churned customers paid via electronic checks, and this group also had the highest average monthly charges.
* Fiber Optics customers showed the highest churn rate and their monthly average charge was 1.7x more than the charges of DSL users and 4.4x more than customers without internet service.
* Customers who opted in for phone service made up 91% of the churned cutomers, showing a common denominator for churned customer.

**Recommendations:**
* Extend personalized offers beyond senior citizens to improve retention among other age groups.
* Review electronic check polocies (possible fees) that may be discouraging customers.
* Improve Fiber Optics service quality or consider pricing adjustments to reduce dissatisfaction.
* Offer bundled discounts or special offers for multi-service customers to lower churned numbers.

**What I learned:**
* I improved my SQL skills by writing intermidiate queries, such as subqueries.
* Learned how to create visualizitions with pivot tables, charts and graphs.
* Practiced clear documentation of data-driven recommendations.
* Applied critical thinking to connect data patterns with business decisions.
